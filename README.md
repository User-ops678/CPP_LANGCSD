# C++ language in csd university, lesson HY-150

I Try my best to write all the code the teacher gave us, So if there are problems feel free to fix them. I wrote
the code in order to see what the teacher did, so because he was pretty fast, i am not able to check for errors, 
because i need to do other stuff as well :) If you want to test your knowlage on the c++ programming lanuage, 
you can try to fix the errors in the files. Dont ask me to fix all the files :) if you want help, you can try to ask me 
or ask the teacher! Thats it! Hope you find it usefull!

Oh and also do not merge or do any other changes to this repository. If you want you can fork this repository to test the changes for yourself!

Hopefully i will be able to write all the code from the first lecture to the last lecture. I'm not sure and i do not guarentee it.
